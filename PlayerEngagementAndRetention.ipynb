    "# Player Engagement & Retention Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook chronicles the cleaning and exploratory analysis of a simulated dataset containing datapoints related to player engagement for a fictional live-service video game. Data visualization for this project can be found at (LINK HERE).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry: Video Games/Live-Service Games\n",
    "Company Type: Major Publisher\n",
    "Primary Audience: Product Managers/Game Designers\n",
    "\n",
    "Core Analytical Question\n",
    "* How do player engagement and retention change before and after a major content update, and which player segments are most affected?\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Stakeholder Questions\n",
    "* Which features or content introduced in the update are most associated with increases or decreases in engagement among different player segments?\n",
    "* Are there identifiable patterns of player behavior post-update that predict long-term retention or churn for high-value segments?\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this analysis is to enable stakeholders (e.g., product managers, live-ops teams, and game designers) to evaluate the impact of a major content update on player engagement and retention, and to identify which player segments are positively or negatively affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing pre- and post-update engagement scores and D1/D7/D30 retention outcomes across player segments, this analysis should allow stakeholders to:\n",
    "* Assess whether the content update successfully increased short-term and long-term player retention\n",
    "* Identify segments at risk of disengagement or churn following the update\n",
    "* Understand how engagement behaviors (frequency, session depth, and social interaction) relate to post-update retention\n",
    "* Inform future content, live-ops timing, and targeted interventions aimed at improving player retention and sustained engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this analysis is intended to support data-informed decisions about content design, update cadence, and post-update player targeting in a live-service game environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I began my data exploration, I defined the relevant terms (\"engagement\" and \"retention\") for the purpose of this analysis."

    "Engagement: A player can be considered engaged based on three criteria: session frequency (played at least 3 days per week or 10 days per month), session duration (played for at least 30 minutes per session), and social interaction (participated in at least one multiplayer event per session). I developed the following formulae to determine an \"engagement score\" for each player:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Frequency score $F=\\frac{Days\\:played\\:in\\:period}{Target\\:days}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Duration score $D=\\frac{Average\\:session\\:duration}{Target\\:duration}$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Social score $S=\\frac{Average\\:social\\:interactions\\:per\\:session}{Target\\:number}$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Engagement score $E=F \\times D \\times S$\n",
    "\n",
    "An engagement score $\\ge$ 1 will indicate an engaged player.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Retention: A player is considered retained if they return to the game and demonstrate continued activity after the reference point (in this case, a major content update). Retention is defined using standard industry benchmarks with window-based criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "D1 Retention: Player logged in and completed at least one gameplay session 1 day after the content update\n",
    "\n",
    "D7 Retention: Player logged in and completed at least one gameplay session within 7 days of the content update\n",
    "\n",
    "D30 Retention: Player logged in and completed at least one gameplay session within 30 days of the content update\n",
    "\n",
    "A “gameplay session” is defined as a session meeting the minimum activity threshold (≥ 30 minutes of playtime), ensuring retention reflects meaningful return behavior rather than a trivial login. These retention metrics are cumulative window-based measures and are used to assess short-, mid-, and long-term player return behavior following the update."
